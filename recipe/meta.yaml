  summary: Handle, manipulate, and convert data with units in Python
  description: |
    A package for handling numpy arrays with units.
    Often writing code that deals with data that has units can be confusing. 
    A function might return an array but at least with plain NumPy arrays, 
    there is no way to easily tell what the units of the data are without somehow knowing them prior.
    The unyt package (pronounced like "unit") provides a subclass of NumPy's 
    ndarray class that knows about units.
